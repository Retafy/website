                <p>Update Effective as of: June 01, 2023</p>
                <p>
                  Retafy has published this Privacy Policy (or privacy notice)
                  to tell you about how we collect, use, disclose and store
                  personal information. We think transparency is important, but
                  providing that transparency requires us to make this notice
                  longer than we would like. That is why we have set out the
                  highlights at the top. We have made the full notice as
                  user-friendly as we could, but we would also welcome your
                  questions and comments.
                </p>

                    <strong>Customers of Our Merchants</strong>– We may obtain
                    your personal information when we provide services to
                    merchants, including merchants that use our services to
                    operate loyalty programs. We process this personal
                    information on our merchants’ behalf and recommend you
                    review your merchant’s privacy policy and contact them with
                    any complaints, questions or requests. We also obtain and
                    control personal information about customers when they use
                    our services directly, such as when they create or use the
                    retafy wallet.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Merchants and Their Users</strong>– Most information
                    we collected about merchants is business information, not
                    personal information. We use any personal information
                    collected to support and better understand our merchants and
                    provide and improve our services.

                    contact information, and information collected through
                    cookies and similar tools. We use this to provide the

                    use your personal information in connection with your

                  <em>What This Notice Covers</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                  This notice applies to all personal information that we
                  collect, use, disclose and store when you apply for a job with
                  retafy or access our services. Our services include the retafy
                  wallet, which allows you to view your reward points across
                  multiple merchants. When you create a retafy wallet, the
                  information you provide to retafy will be subject to this
                  notice, including any reward points information that retafy
                  obtains from merchants in connection with your wallet.
                  “retafy” includes retafy Inc. and any related companies
                  anywhere in the world.
                </p>

                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Merchants</strong>: As mentioned above, we process
                    personal information for others, including merchants. Please
                    direct any complaints, questions or requests related to your
                    personal information directly to those merchants. In the
                    event you are not satisfied with how they respond, you may
                    contact us directly, but we cannot guarantee we will be able
                    to address it. If you do not create a retafy wallet, retafy
                    does not control your reward point information. If you
                    create a retafy wallet, each of retafy and the applicable
                    merchant will control a copy of your reward points and each
                    will know if your reward point totals change, such as when
                    you earn new points or spend points.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Non-Personal Information</strong>: Information about
                    your business, including your business contact information,
                    is not typically personal information. Anonymized
                    information is also not considered personal information for
                    the purposes of this notice. We may anonymize any personal
                    information in our custody, in which case it will cease to
                    be personal information.

                </ul>
                <p>
                  In some situations, we may rely on exemptions or other
                  permitted conduct under applicable laws, including to collect,
                  use, disclose or store personal information for purposes not
                  described in this notice. We provide services to merchants in
                  many jurisdictions and privacy practices may be adopted to
                  address the specific privacy requirements of particular
                  jurisdictions. If you are unsure if or how this notice applies

                <h2>Changes to this Notice </h2>
                <p>
                  Please note that we may update this notice from time to time
                  to reflect changes in our privacy practices by providing you
                  with notice of the changes. Notice includes but is not
                  restricted to posting a link to the new notice, posting a new
                  notice at retafy.com/privacy-policy, or sending you a link to
                  the new notice via contact information you have provided to
                  us. Such changes will be effective with respect to your use of
                  retafy’s services after retafy has given notice of the
                  changes. Please review this notice periodically to see whether
                  it has been updated. Any use of retafy’s services by you after
                  we provide notice constitutes your acceptance of those
                  changes.

                <h2>Processing of Personal Information</h2>
                <p>
                  Much of the personal information we process is necessary to
                  provide our services and meet our contractual obligations. In
                  most other situations, we rely on our legitimate interest
                  (which, in some countries, would be “implied consent” or a
                  legal exception to the consent requirement, such as where the
                  processing is to prevent fraud). The specific purposes for
                  which we process personal information include to:
                </p>
                <ul>

                  <li>
                    deliver content and information to third parties including
                    other merchants and their customers

                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  While not stated as a purpose below, we may also use any

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    For security purposes, including to detect, prevent and
                    investigate potential fraud
                  </li>
                  <li>Where required or permitted by law</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  We may also request express consent to process your personal
                  information in some circumstances, such as when you sign up as
                  a merchant or a user for a merchant or when you visit our
                  website and we use cookies or when you create a retafy wallet.
                  We may also de-personalize information, such as through
                  anonymization or aggregation. We may use and disclose such
                  information for any purpose, as it will no longer identify you
                  or any other person.

                  control much of the personal information processed by retafy,

                <p>
                  As a security measure, our Privacy Officer may request
                  specific information from you in order to verify your identity
                  prior to granting any requests. If we cannot respond to your
                  request promptly or have to refuse the request, we will advise
                  you of the reasons, subject to any legal restrictions. If you
                  disagree with our determination, you may complain to us and we

                <p>
                  We only store personal information as long as necessary to

                  collected, to conduct our business operations and maintain an

                  after which time the personal information is destroyed or
                  erased. We may, instead of destroying or erasing your personal
                  information, make it anonymous such that it cannot be
                  associated with, or tracked back to, you.

                <h2>Securing Your Personal Information</h2>
                <p>
                  We take steps to maintain physical, technical and procedural
                  safeguards that are appropriate to the sensitivity of your
                  personal information. These safeguards are intended to prevent
                  your personal information from loss and unauthorized access,
                  copying, use, modification or disclosure. However, the
                  internet is not a secure environment and no computer system is
                  perfectly secure. As such, we cannot guarantee the security of
                  personal information provided to us through electronic means:
                  there is always a risk that your personal information may be
                  accessed or used without authorization.
